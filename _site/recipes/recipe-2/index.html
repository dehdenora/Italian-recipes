<ul>
<li>Difficulty: <strong>Medium</strong></li>
<li>Preparation: <strong>15 minutes</strong></li>
<li>Cook time: <strong>20 minutes</strong></li>
<li>Serving: <strong>4 people</strong></li>
<li>Cost: <strong>High</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Arborio rice: 320g</li>
<li>Beef broth, kept warm: as required</li>
<li>White onions: 1/2</li>
<li>White wine: 150g</li>
<li>Saffron threads: 0,25g</li>
</ul>
<h4>Final phase of sauteing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Butter (fridge temperature): 120g</li>
<li>Parmesan Cheese, grated: 80g</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a small bowl, soak the saffron threads in a few tablespoons of warm water to release their flavor and color. Set aside.</li>
<li>In a separate pot, heat the beef broth and keep it warm on low heat.</li>
<li>In a large pan or skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and saut√© until it becomes translucent.</li>
<li>Add the Arborio rice to the pan and toast it for a couple of minutes, stirring to coat the rice evenly with the oil.</li>
<li>Pour in the white wine and stir until the wine is mostly absorbed by the rice.</li>
<li>Begin adding the warm broth to the rice one ladle at a time. Stir frequently and allow the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to an al dente texture.</li>
<li>About halfway through the cooking process, add the saffron-infused water to the risotto, ensuring even distribution of the saffron throughout the dish.</li>
<li>Once the rice is cooked, stir in the remaining butter and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
<li>Serve the Risotto alla Milanese hot, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
