Risotto alla Milanese is a classic risotto in the region of Lombardy, known for its rich saffron flavor, and usually paired with ossobuco (sliced veal shank).

*   Difficulty: **Medium**
*   Preparation: **15 minutes**
*   Cook time: **20 minutes**
*   Serving: **4 people**
*   Cost: **High**

### Ingredients

*   Arborio rice: 320g
*   Beef broth, kept warm: as required
*   White onions: 1/2
*   White wine: 150g
*   Saffron threads: 0,25g

#### Final phase of sauteing

*   Butter (fridge temperature): 120g
*   Parmesan Cheese, grated: 80g

### Instructions

1.  In a small bowl, soak the saffron threads in a few tablespoons of warm water to release their flavor and color. Set aside.
2.  In a separate pot, heat the beef broth and keep it warm on low heat.
3.  In a large pan or skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and saut√© until it becomes translucent.
4.  Add the Arborio rice to the pan and toast it for a couple of minutes, stirring to coat the rice evenly with the oil.
5.  Pour in the white wine and stir until the wine is mostly absorbed by the rice.
6.  Begin adding the warm broth to the rice one ladle at a time. Stir frequently and allow the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to an al dente texture.
7.  About halfway through the cooking process, add the saffron-infused water to the risotto, ensuring even distribution of the saffron throughout the dish.
8.  Once the rice is cooked, stir in the remaining butter and grated Parmesan cheese.
9.  Serve the Risotto alla Milanese hot, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese if desired.
