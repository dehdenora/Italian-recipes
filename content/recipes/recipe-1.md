*   Cost: **Low**

### Ingredients:

*   Arborio rice: 320g
*   Vegetable broth, kept warm: as required
*   Dry white wine: 40g
*   Zest of 2 lemons
*   Juice of 1 lemon
*   Onion: 1/2
*   Garlic: 1
*   Salt to taste

#### Final phase of sauteing

*   Butter (fridge temperature): 75g

### Instructions:

1.  In a separate pot, heat the vegetable broth and keep it warm on low heat.
2.  In a large pan or skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add finely chopped onion and sauté until softened.
3.  Add minced garlic to the onions and sauté for an additional minute until fragrant.
4.  Add Arborio rice to the pan and toast it for a couple of minutes, stirring to coat the rice evenly with the oil.

7.  Stir in lemon zest, lemon juice, grated Parmesan cheese, and butter.
8.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
9.  Serve the Risotto al limone hot, garnished with extra Parmesan if desired.
