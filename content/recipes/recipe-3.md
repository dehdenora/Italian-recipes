Risotto alla zucca is a delightful and flavorful dish, perfect for the fall season.

### Ingredients

*   Arborio rice: 320g
*   Vegetal broth, kept warm: as required
*   Brown onions: 100g
*   White wine: 60g
*   Pumpkin: 750g
*   Salt to taste

#### Final phase of sauteing

*   Butter (fridge temperature): 50g
*   Parmesan Cheese, grated: 80g

### Instructions:

1.  In a separate pot, heat the vegetable broth and keep it warm on low heat.
2.  In a large pan or skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add finely chopped onion and saut√© until softened.
3.  Add Arborio rice to the pan and toast it for a couple of minutes, stirring to coat the rice evenly with the oil and butter.
4.  Pour in white wine and stir until the wine is mostly absorbed by the rice.
5.  Begin adding the warm broth to the rice one ladle at a time. Stir frequently and allow the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to an al dente texture.
6.  Add diced pumpkin to the risotto when it's about halfway cooked. Continue adding broth and stirring until the rice is creamy, and the pumpkin is tender.
7.  Stir in grated Parmesan cheese and butter.
8.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
9.  Serve the Risotto Zucca hot, garnished with extra Parmesan if desired.
