Gnocchi with Pesto di Pistacchi is a rich and creamy dish with the nutty flavor of pistachios, perfect for a quick yet elegant meal.

### Ingredients:

*   Gnocchi: 500g
*   Pistachios (unsalted and shelled): 100g
*   Fresh basil leaves: a handful
*   Parmesan cheese, grated: 50g
*   Garlic: 1 clove
*   Olive oil: 60ml (about 4 tbsp)
*   Heavy cream: 100ml
*   Salt to taste
*   Black pepper to taste

#### For garnish:

*   Crushed pistachios
*   Fresh basil leaves
*   Extra Parmesan cheese (optional)

### Instructions:

1.  In a food processor, add the pistachios, basil, garlic, grated Parmesan, and a pinch of salt. Pulse a few times to combine the ingredients.
2.  With the food processor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the mixture forms a smooth, creamy pesto. Adjust the consistency with a little water if necessary.
3.  In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil. Cook the gnocchi according to the package instructions or until they float to the surface, about 2-3 minutes.
4.  While the gnocchi is cooking, transfer the pistachio pesto to a large pan over low heat. Stir in the heavy cream and gently warm the sauce without letting it boil.
5.  Drain the gnocchi and add them directly to the pan with the pesto sauce. Stir gently to coat the gnocchi evenly in the sauce.
6.  Season with salt and black pepper to taste, and cook for 1-2 minutes until everything is well combined and heated through.
7.  Serve the **Gnocchi with Pesto di Pistacchi** hot, garnished with crushed pistachios, fresh basil leaves, and extra Parmesan cheese if desired.
