*   Cost: **Low**

### Ingredients:

*   Gnocchi: 500g
*   Tomato passata: 600g
*   Fresh mozzarella, diced: 250g
*   Parmesan cheese, grated: 50g
*   Olive oil: 2 tbsp
*   Garlic: 2 cloves, minced
*   Fresh basil leaves: a handful
*   Salt to taste
*   Black pepper to taste

#### For baking:

*   Parmesan cheese, grated: 30g
*   Fresh mozzarella, sliced: 100g

### Instructions:

1.  Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F).
2.  In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.
3.  Pour the tomato passata into the pan, add salt and pepper to taste, and let the sauce simmer for about 15 minutes until slightly thickened. Stir occasionally.
4.  Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the gnocchi according to package instructions or until they float to the surface, which usually takes about 2-3 minutes.
5.  Drain the gnocchi and add them to the pan with the tomato sauce. Stir to coat the gnocchi evenly in the sauce.
6.  Add the diced mozzarella and a handful of fresh basil leaves to the gnocchi and sauce mixture. Stir gently to combine.
7.  Transfer the gnocchi mixture to a baking dish. Top with sliced mozzarella and grated Parmesan.
8.  Bake in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly with a golden crust on top.
9.  Remove from the oven, garnish with fresh basil leaves, and serve hot.
