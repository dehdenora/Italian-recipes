Gnocchi alla Norma is a delightful Sicilian dish with the perfect combination of eggplant, tomato sauce, and creamy cheese.

### Ingredients:

*   Gnocchi: 500g
*   Eggplant: 1 large, diced
*   Tomato passata: 600g
*   Fresh ricotta or ricotta salata, grated: 150g
*   Olive oil: 4 tbsp
*   Garlic: 2 cloves, minced
*   Fresh basil leaves: a handful
*   Salt to taste
*   Black pepper to taste

#### For serving:

*   Fresh basil leaves for garnish
*   Extra grated ricotta salata or Parmesan (optional)

### Instructions:

1.  In a large pan, heat 3 tbsp of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the diced eggplant and sauté until golden brown and softened, about 10-12 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.
2.  In the same pan, heat the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil. Add minced garlic and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.
3.  Add the tomato passata to the pan, season with salt and pepper, and let the sauce simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened.
4.  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the gnocchi according to the package instructions or until they float to the surface, about 2-3 minutes.
5.  Drain the gnocchi and add them to the pan with the tomato sauce. Stir gently to coat the gnocchi evenly.
6.  Return the sautéed eggplant to the pan and mix everything together carefully.
7.  Add a handful of fresh basil leaves and half of the grated ricotta salata or fresh ricotta to the gnocchi mixture. Stir gently to combine.
8.  Serve the Gnocchi alla Norma hot, garnished with the remaining ricotta salata and extra basil leaves.
9.  Optionally, top with extra grated cheese for an added layer of flavor.
